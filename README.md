# Custom version of states_rebuilder for Groqhealth

This is a modified version of states_rebuilder version 4.0.0+1, updated to work with the latest version of Flutter.
We stopped upgrading to newer version of states_rebuilder because the architecture changes and general direction the plugin creator 
took did not align with the way we use the plugin.
